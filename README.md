## Devil told me keep doin this shit

work on it until it makes you rich

Talk is cheap

Talk less, do more. There is no point of talking.

People are insecure. they do good posts, stories on ig to make them feel that they are doing something and are better.

Like I was posting beats on ig, yt to make myself feel that I was doing something coz in reality I was insecure and had nothing solid to show.

My insecurities: Coding skills, english and looks.
