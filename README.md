### You gon see better days bro don't giveup. 
### work hard af. practice ur focus whenever possible.
idc i want it asap. speed run it then think about wanna live or die.
### I don't stop. work and sleep.

get a job, go to bangalore, start making music and be the first Indian programmer , english rapper with global level shit.

I wanna be the best indian english rapper. touching electronic, pluggnb, mumble, supertrap.
First rapper mastered rapping over redda type, supertrap beats.

give urself a chance till 24 and do whatever the fuck it takes to become successful. if u didn't reach the state u wanted, if things didn't go well even after that then kill yourself. till then do whatever it takes. sacrifices, habits, speed, decisions, fuck distractions etc. no lame ass social media shit.

this time won't come back. use it wisely. thinking and doing right things. average person keep swiping their phone.

take care of your brain.

staying calm, humble, smiling more, talking less, doing more, staying calm, focused and quick is my speciality.

work on it until it makes you rich

<summary>Talk is cheap</summary><br>
Talk less, do more. There is no point of talking.

People are insecure. they do good posts, stories on ig to make them feel that they are doing something and are better.

Like I was posting beats on ig, yt to make myself feel that I was doing something coz in reality I was insecure and had no solid foundation.

My insecurities: Coding skills, english and looks.

evrything in life can be variable but my one thing will be constant.

I don't wanna be in jabalpur. I wanna level up so hard. no shit around me. 

I know material shit means nothing. but i don't wanna just talk about being highly successful. I wanna be successful. idc imma grind like a demon till 24.

Just tell me what to finish. I start and do that. no lame ass comfort shit.

there is a way for everything. don't be lazy or play your mind to not to do it. atleast give it a try. it's better than wasting time on social media.

kuch bhi khrab ho jaye. kuch bhi chala jaye but apni life mat khrab kr lena

dusro se jitna kam expect kar sakte ho karo and zyada se zyada accept karo.

find reasons to live. not excuses to die.

I wanna be rich so that i can take my girl to japan and travel the whole country.
