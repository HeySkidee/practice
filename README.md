### guy works hard af
### Devil told me keep doin this shit

give urself a chance till 24 and do whatever the fuck it takes to become successful. if u didn't reach the state u wanted, if things didn't go well even after that then kill yourself.

till then do whatever it takes. sacrifices, habits, speed, decisions, fuck distractions etc.

staying calm, humble, smiling more, talking less, doing more, staying calm, focused and quick is my speciality.

work on it until it makes you rich

Talk less, do more. There is no point of talking.

People are insecure. they do good posts, stories on ig to make them feel that they are doing something and are better.

Like I was posting beats on ig, yt to make myself feel that I was doing something coz in reality I was insecure and had no solid foundation.

My insecurities: Coding skills, english and looks.

evrything in life can be variable but my one thing will be constant.

I don't wanna be in jabalpur. I wanna level up so hard. no shit around me. 

I know material shit means nothing. but i don't wanna just talk about being highly successful. I wanna be successful. idc imma grind like a demon till 24.

Just tell me what to finish. I start and do that. no lame ass comfort shit.

there is a way for everything. don't be lazy or play your mind to not to do it. atleast give it a try. it's better than wasting time on social media.
